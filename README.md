# Cron Parser

The goal is to provide human-readable description of a given cron expression.

## Using the Application
The application accepts as a single-line input a cron expression and the associated command, e.g.
```shell
cron-parser "*/15 0 1,15 * 1-5 echo foo"
```

Note that the expression and command must all be wrapped in a single pair of quotes.
For more details, consult the [details of cron expression](#cron-expression).

## Distributing the Application
The application is distributed as a tar or zip archive. Those can be generated by
```shell
./gradlew assembleDist
```

The executable scripts are in the `bin` directory of the extracted archive.

## Cron Expression

Each cron expression has the same structure `<minute-of-hour> <hour-of-day> <day-of-month> <month-of-year> <day-of-week>`.

Moreover, each of the fields is a comma-separated list of values adhering to the field semantics (e.g. you cannot use 'MON' for minute).
The field values neither contain spaces nor can they be separated with them.

Each of those values can be in one of the following formats:
- a value, e.g. `1` or `53`
- a range, e.g. `1-10` or `43-50`
- a wildcard, `*`
- an interval, e.g. `1/15` or `1-10/3` or `*/20`

Note that
- range includes both ends, i.e. `1-3` == `1,2,3`
- wildcard covers entire range, i.e. for _day-of-week_ field `*` == `0,1,2,3,4,5,6`
- interval can have an implicit end, i.e. for _day-of-week_ field, `2/3` == `2-6/3` == `2,5`

For more details on the actual values of these fields, consult the standard cron specification.
