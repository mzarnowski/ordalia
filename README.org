* Product Offer Aggregation
** Objective
Build an application that aggregates offers for a product.

An offer has two attributes:
- a floating point "price"
- a string "productCode".

A "product offer aggregation" has the following attributes:
- min price of the aggregated offers
- max price of the aggregated offers
- average price of the aggregated offers
- count of the offers

An aggregation can be in two states: ~open~ or ~closed~

Only aggregations with more than =N= offers can be closed, where =N= is
configurable and defaults to 3.

Sample data is [[file:data.csv][here]].

*** Acceptance criteria
- A closed aggregation does not accept any more offers.
- The service's API should allow:
  - querying for an aggregation for a given product code
  - closing the aggregation
  - supplying offers for the aggregation
- The offers to aggregate should be batched or streamed.
