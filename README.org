* Simple Data Warehouse (ETL+Query)
** Objective
Write a simple backend application that exposes data - extracted from a CSV file - via an API. The file can be found here:

Sample data can be found [[file:data.csv][here]].

Transform it to your needs so it can be loaded into your chosen data store.
The API should make it possible to query the data in a generic and efficient way.

*** Possible queries
- Total Clicks for a given Datasource for a given Date range
- Click-Through Rate (CTR) per Datasource and Campaign
- Impressions over time (daily)

*** Data Points
    Time dimension (Date)
    regular dimensions (Campaign, Datasource)
    metrics (Clicks, Impressions)

*** The API parameters
- Set of metrics including calculated ones to be aggregated on
- Optional set of dimensions to be grouped by
- Optional set of dimension filters to be filtered on

*** Requirements
- Design any architecture that fits the problem/use case best
- Model the API contract on your behalf
- Use any additional tech that helps extract, transform, load and query the data

*** Deliverable
- a deployable container
